# Complete Guide to Understanding and Building Agents

## üéØ What You've Built

You now have a comprehensive email management agent system that demonstrates all key agent concepts:

### Core Agent Framework (`src/agent/base.py`)
- **Perceive-Think-Act loop**: The fundamental agent architecture
- **Tool system**: How agents use capabilities to achieve goals
- **Memory integration**: Context and learning across interactions

### Specialized Sub-Agents
1. **EmailClassifier** - Pattern recognition and categorization
2. **EmailResponder** - AI-powered content generation
3. **InboxOrganizer** - Workflow automation and maintenance
4. **EmailMasterAgent** - Multi-agent orchestration

### Advanced Features
- **Persistent memory** with learning capabilities
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **User feedback integration** for continuous improvement
- **CLI interface** for practical interaction

## üß† Key Agent Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Autonomy vs Reactivity

**Bots (Reactive)**:
```python
def process_command(self, command):
    if command == "hello":
        return "Hi there!"
    # Simple if/else logic
```

**Agents (Autonomous)**:
```python
def run_cycle(self):
    perception = self.perceive()      # Gather environment info
    actions = self.think(perception)  # Reason and plan
    results = self.act(actions)       # Execute using tools
    return results
```

### 2. Tool Usage and Capabilities

Agents use tools to extend their capabilities:
```python
# Email classification tool
self.register_tool(Tool(
    name="classify_category",
    description="Classify email into a primary category",
    function=classify_email_category
))

# Use the tool
result = self.use_tool("classify_category", email=email_data)
```

### 3. Learning and Adaptation

Agents learn from user feedback:
```python
def _learn_from_feedback(self, event_id, feedback_type, feedback_value):
    # Update preferences based on user corrections
    if feedback_type == "classification_correction":
        self._update_classification_preference(event, feedback_value)
```

### 4. Multi-Agent Coordination

Master agent orchestrates sub-agents:
```python
# Parallel processing with multiple agents
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    classification_future = executor.submit(self.classifier.run_cycle)
    response_future = executor.submit(self.responder.run_cycle) 
    organization_future = executor.submit(self.organizer.run_cycle)
```

## üíº Building Your Own Agents

### Step 1: Define the Agent's Purpose

```python
class MySpecializedAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="MyAgent",
            description="Specific purpose and capabilities"
        )
```

### Step 2: Create Specialized Tools

```python
def my_domain_tool(self, input_data):
    # Process input according to domain logic
    # Return processed result
    pass

self.register_tool(Tool(
    name="my_tool",
    description="What this tool does",
    function=my_domain_tool
))
```

### Step 3: Implement Agent Logic

```python
def perceive(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # What information does your agent need?
    # How does it sense the environment?
    pass

def think(self, perception: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # How does your agent reason about the situation?
    # What actions should it plan?
    pass

def act(self, actions: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[ToolResult]:
    # How does your agent execute its plans?
    # Which tools does it use?
    pass
```
